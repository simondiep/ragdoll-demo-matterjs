# ragdoll-demo-matter-js-physics-engine

An example ragdoll leveraging matter-js physics engine.

## Controls

QWOP each move a different body part upwards

## Findings

- Ragdoll physics are glitchy, with collisions causing random bursts of movement
- The engine is actively maintained
- The documentation is pretty good
- There are a decent amount of user examples available

## Ideas

- zoom out the faster the body is moving
- add goal and win screen
- depending on which quadrant you click in, show a different leg, such as from below or to the left
- hold click to get bigger leg
- multiplayer
- sound effects
