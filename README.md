- The engine is actively maintained
- The documentation is pretty good
- There are a decent amount of user examples available

## Ideas

- zoom out the faster the body is moving
- Goal
  - Arrow pointer towards goal if offscreen
  - Generate new goal on arrival
  - Keep track of score
- multiplayer
- sound effects
- sprites
